Using Official RPi touch displayÂ¶

If you are using the official Raspberry Pi touch display, you need to configure Kivy to use it as an input source. To do this, edit the file ~/.kivy/config.ini and go to the [input] section. Add this:

mouse = mouse
mtdev_%(name)s = probesysfs,provider=mtdev
hid_%(name)s = probesysfs,provider=hidinput
